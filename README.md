# **Project: "CTA Travel Time Impact Analysis"**

## Overview:
The "CTA Travel Time Impact Analysis" investigates the economic consequences of potential Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) service reductions. Leveraging a multidisciplinary approach, this study combines transportation data, economic modeling, and machine learning techniques to assess the impact on travel time for commuters and residents.

## Key Components and Techniques:
1. **OD Pair Analysis**:
   - Utilizing transportation network data, we identify Origin-Destination (OD) pairs for trips within Chicago.
   - Algorithms: Geospatial clustering, k-means, and network analysis.

2. **Trip Categorization**:
   - Distinguishing between work-related and personal trips based on trip purpose.
   - Machine learning models: Decision trees, logistic regression.

3. **Geospatial Mapping**:
   - Mapping relevant regions (e.g., downtown, business districts, residential zones) using Census Tract Boundaries.
   - Tools: GeoPandas, Folium.

4. **GTFS Data Integration**:
   - Extracting transit schedules, routes, and stops from the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS).
   - APIs: GTFS-realtime, TransitChicago.

5. **Economic Valuation**:
   - Estimating the economic value of travel time patterns.
   - Techniques: Travel time costs, benefit analysis.

6. **Regression Modeling**:
   - Predicting travel time changes based on CTA service reductions.
   - Regression algorithms: Linear regression, random forests.

7. **Infrastructure Challenges Consideration**:
   - Addressing slow growth in transit ridership, aging infrastructure, and changing travel patterns.
   - Mitigation strategies: Capital funding, land use planning.

## Expected Outcomes:
- Quantified economic impact of reduced CTA services.
- Insights for policymakers, urban planners, and commuters.
- Recommendations for sustainable transit investment.
